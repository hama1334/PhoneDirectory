This is a very basic yet stable version of the PhoneDirectory app. 
The program constructs and manages an always-sorted doubly-linked list 
with phone contacts - Respectively Name, Surname and Phone Number.
In this embryonic version, the program simply interacts with the user 
(i.e. receives inpout from keyboard only) and does not store information 
on the disk or other media (i.e. a PhoneDirectory cannot be 'saved' 
nor of course 'retrived').

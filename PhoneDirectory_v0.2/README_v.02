The version 0.2 of the PhoneDirectory Application is able to manage a phone
directory using a doubly linked list and to save the contents of the
PhoneDirectory into a file ("datafile"), as well as of course to read the data
saved from that file. 
The next version is planned to have for fields for each record (such as office
and home phone, as well as email) as well as more sophisticated search.

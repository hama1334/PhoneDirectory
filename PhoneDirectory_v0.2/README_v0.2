This is the version 0.2 of the PhoneDirectory Application. The primary addition in this version is the capability
to store data in a file named "PhoneBookFile.txt", so that the application can be of some true practical use. 
The application in this version will also do better bound checking in input and source code now is separated. 
The different source code files represent a first effort to  divide data management from business logic and from 
presentation/UI.
